Steps to Implement 

1. The button on the first screen takes the user to the second screen 

2. Create a tab controller with four tabs. Make use of appropriate images and title to represent each tab i.e as seen in the design 

3. The second and third screens should have a navigation controller.  

4. The second and third screens found above should be exact replicas using the same UI controls. 
 
5. Switch between Today and Area screens with the All Habits and New Area controls. 

6. The fourth screen should segue when the plus(“+”) button in the second/third screen is clicked 

7. Make use of table view to create the second screen and feel free to make use of dummy data to represent each cell. 

8. The second, third and fourth tabs should display an alert when clicked. The alert should read “progress was clicked “, “upgrade was clicked”, “’settings’ was clicked”.
